### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
*After this lesson, you will be able to:*

- Understand and build decision tree models for classification and regression with the sklearn library
- Understand and build random forest models for classification and regression
- Know how to extract the most important predictors in a random forest model


### STUDENT PRE-WORK
*Before this lesson, you should already be able to:*

- Know how to build and evaluate (classification) models in sklearn
- Knowledge of resampling methods
- Understand the concepts of cross-validation and overfitting


### Additional Resources
*If you're interested in reading more about decision trees and random forests, check these out:*
- [Induction of Decision Trees](http://hunch.net/~coms-4771/quinlan.pdf)
- [Top 10 Algorithms in Data Mining](http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~icdm/algorithms/10Algorithms-08.pdf)


*Also, I highly recommend checking out the following books:*
- __CHAPTER 8__ - [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) - This book provides a fantastic introduction to machine learning models and the statistics behind them. The visuals and explanations are really easy to understand.
- __CHAPTER 9__ - [Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) - This book is by most of the same authors as the previous book, but goes into more detail.
- __CHAPTER 8__ - [Applied Predictive Modeling](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Predictive-Modeling-Max-Kuhn/dp/1461468485) - While this book features R code, the discussion of different predictive models and sampling methodologies are hard to beat.
